Most microblogging services are designed to be used in a certain way. For example, Twitter places a 280-character limit on the length of posts.Microblogging is a fast way to communicate with audiences.

For brands, it can be a way to make product announcements or clarifications, link to longer content posts, seem more personable or engage in conversations with customers.",
